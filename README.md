# React TypeScript Supabase Starter

[![React-App-CI](https://github.com/mwolfhoffman/react-jack/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/mwolfhoffman/eact-typescript-supabase-starter/actions/workflows/main.yml)


I use React, Redux, and TypeScript for a lot of UIs that I build, so I created this starter to reduce a lot of the mundane boiler plate for new front end projects. 

This starter includes React, Redux, TypeScript, React-Router, and Supabase (an open source firebase alternative). I have also added CI pipeline steps with Github Actions

## To Run: 

1. Create Supabase Project and add Anon Key and API URL to `.env` file.

2. Install modules and start dev server: 
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

3. Run tests:
```
yarn test
```
